 * Tp::Account::ensureTextChat or AccountsModel::ensureTextChat, and calling
 * start(), or by ClientHandler in response to an incoming channel (which goes
 * through setChannel()).
 *
 * Currently, notification when they're created is done entirely through
 * ClientHandler, but that should probably change. It's also currently
 * responsible for creating the ChatModel, but that might be better done within
 * QML now.
